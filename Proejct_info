**Main Research Question*** 

Can the severity of atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis), as measured by the SCORAD score, be predicted by the transcriptome ?

Secondary question:

How do additional variables (clinical characteristics) relate to this?


Data structure as per the researcher

Initial sample size
n = 351 

Atopic dermatitis ;  n – 91
Psoriasis;                 n – 134
Healthy volunteer;   n – 126

Removed 35 genes during the QC

Final matched samples n = 316
AD,   n = 82
PSO, n = 119
HV, n = 115


ECZEMA related database

n = 82
From each participant:
Sick skin  - 82
healthy skin – 82

Healthy controls
n = 115

healthy skin *2 = 230


RNA Expression

n = 326233



Clinical data : Demographics; Age, sex origin, family history and history of diseases

Transcriptome: 
Data from Micro- array quantitative data, 
expression intensity of each gene: minimum 0 to maximum 12
